this is an API project working as alyer on front of several  servers and check wheter this server is running or can handle new request or no  then it will give a list of working 
servers to the client  so the client can know the working servers and send request to ; 



in many cases in high trafic application with ahuge transaction a big request payload  may be even the load balancer stop 
so if you have more that LB or service server you need you will call this API to get the running servers
